FLAT MODEL (3 EPOCHS):
Best val acc 0.377

FLAT MODEL (10 EPOCHS):
Best val acc 0.392

FLAT MODEL + AUGMENTATION (10 EPOCHS):
Best val acc: val acc 0.364

FLAT MODEL + AUGMENTATION (30 EPOCHS):

TINY CNN (3 EPOCHS):
Best  val acc: 0.581

TINY CNN(10 EPOCHS):
Best val acc: 0.647

TINY CNN + AUGMENTATION (10 EPOCHS):
Best val acc : 0.641

---------> CNN's accuracy is leaps and bounds better than FLAT MODEL so the next few adjustments will be applied only on CNN


#MODIFIED 30 EPOCHS FOR THE AUGMENTATION TO PROVE ITS WORTH ALONG WITH THE SCHEDULER
TINY CNN + AUGMENTATION + SCHEDULER (30 EPOCHS):
Best val acc: 0.688

--------->Adding a scheduler and adding more epochs contributed to adding 4.7% accuracy to the MODEL

#Changed CNN to a wider one with 64x64 instead of 32x32; testing the CNN's width impact on the accuracy of project:
Wide CNN + AUGMENTATION + SCHEDULER (30 EPOCHS):
Best val acc: 0.73

----------> Adding a wider CNN instead of the tiny one added the results by 4% to the MODEL

#Changing into a deeper CNN with 128x128 to see if there's a limit to how much it improves accuracy
Deep CNN + AUGMENTATION + SCHEDULER (30 EPOCHS):
Best val acc 0.784

---------->There is still a large improvement of almost 5,6% Accuracy upon making the model deep.

#Changing into an even deeper CNN; 4 block one to test the limit; see if we reached the cap of improving accuracy by widening the model
4 block CNN + AUGMENTATION + SCHEDULER (30 EPOCHS):
Best val acc 0.818

---------->Still a big improvement of 3% Accuracy; widening the model seems to still give us even more accuracy.

#Adding another layer to the CNN to test when the diminishing returns start to appear upon adding more and more layers
5 block CNN + AUGMENTATION + SCHEDULER (30 EPOCHS):
Best val acc 0.825

----------> About a 1.5% improvement; widening it seems to add more accuracy but it isn't noteworthy; we are at the point of diminishing returns;
Adding any more blocks would eventually cause the model to overfit and it is not cost effective.

The system went from a measly 0.377 accuracy to approximately 0.83 after additional changes.
